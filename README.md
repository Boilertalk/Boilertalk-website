# BoilertalkWebsite

This is a new version of our Boilertalk website. I like Dart, but it is very hard to find proficient developers (myself included).
So I decided to use Angular with Typescript for all our frontends.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.0.
The angular CLI and angular version are updated regularly.

## Development server

Use npm install to install all dependencies. Make sure your node version is above 8.0.0.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Actually, I temporarly removed karma because it currently has multiple security vulnerabilities in its dependencies. Furthermore, this website doesn't use any real logic.
